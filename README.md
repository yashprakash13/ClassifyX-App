# ClassifyX-App



## This is the Android application for the XRay Classification Neural Network Model. It uses the tensorflow API for the simple deployment of the model in the app. 
Users can upload a picture of an Xray through their phone camera or choose an Xray from their device storage. The model is built to clasify the chosen XRay into one of the five category of diseases.

Here is the model: https://github.com/yashprakash13/X-Ray-Classification?files=1
